# ConsoleAppCalculator

This code is a basic calculator program written in C#. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, /, or *) and then calculates the result based on the operator.

The code begins by printing a welcome message and asking the user to enter the first number. It then reads in the first number using the Console.ReadLine() method and converts it to a double using the Convert.ToDouble() method. The code then prompts the user to enter an operator and reads in the operator using Console.ReadLine().

Next, the code prompts the user to enter the second number and reads it in using Console.ReadLine(). The second number is also converted to a double using the Convert.ToDouble() method.

The code then uses a series of if-else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the operator entered by the user. If the operator is +, -, /, or *, the code performs the appropriate calculation and prints the result to the console. If the operator is not one of these four, the code prints an error message indicating that the operator is invalid.

Finally, the code waits for the user to press Enter before exiting the program using the Console.ReadLine() method.

Overall, this code provides a basic example of how to create a simple calculator program in C#.
